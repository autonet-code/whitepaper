# Autonet Whitepaper

## Current Paper

**[Emergent Alignment: Economic Mechanisms for the Peaceful Transfer of Work from Humans to AI](emergent_alignment.md)**

Andrei Taranu (Eight Rice) | February 2026

Submitted to the Stanford Journal of Blockchain Law & Policy, special issue for the Kleros-Stanford Symposium on Decentralized Justice and AI.

The paper argues that AI alignment is an economic coordination problem, not a technical constraint problem. It presents an integrated architecture where alignment emerges from the aggregation of individual value structures within governed jurisdictions, enforced through continuous economic gradients rather than binary prohibitions.

## Legacy

The [2021 whitepaper](legacy/autonet_2021.pdf) by Andrei Taranu and Leonhard Horstmeyer introduced the foundational insight that intelligence is the substrate of economic value, and proposed Autonet as an Economy-as-a-Service for deep learning. The current paper builds on that foundation with deployed smart contracts, tested decentralized training protocols, and a formal alignment framework.
